Smart Home Automation
Project Title: SmartHomeControl â€“ Home Automation System with CI/CD

Summary:
- Develop a web application that enables users to control various smart home devices, such as lights, thermostats, and security systems, from a unified interface. The application will employ a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab for source control and CI/CD, Docker for containerization, and AWS for cloud hosting. The application will utilize MQTT for communication with IoT devices and store user preferences and device configurations in a managed database service like AWS DynamoDB or Firebase.

Objectives:
- Unified Control Interface: To create a web application that integrates various smart home devices for easy management
- Real-Time Communication: Implement MQTT as the communication protocol for efficient messaging between the application and IoT devices
- Cloud Deployment: Utilize AWS services for cloud hosting, ensuring scalability and reliability
- CI/CD Implementation: Establish a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab to automate testing and deployment processes
- User Preference Management: Store user preferences and device configurations in a managed database service like AWS DynamoDB or Firebase
